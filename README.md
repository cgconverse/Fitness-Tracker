# Fitness-Tracker

## Description

A consumer will quickly achieve their fitness goals when they track their workout progress.

## User Story

As a user, I want to be able to view create and track daily workouts. I want to be able to log multiple exercises in a workout on a given day. I should also be able to track the name, type, weight, sets, reps, and duration of exercise. If the exercise is a cardio exercise, I should be able to track my distance traveled.

## Usage

When I load the page, I can choose to create a new workout or continue with my last workout.

When I click on 'Dashboard' I am redirected to the 'stats' page which displays data from the past seven workouts.

On the 'stats' page I can view the combined weight of multiple exercises as well as the total duration of each workout.
